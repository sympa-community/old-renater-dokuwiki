===== one_time_ticket =====

(start with version 6.0)

A new authentication mechanism has been introduced. It is a well known method in many web sites where new users or users who have lost there password can choose a new password (or a first one). A challenge email is sent to the user with an URL that contains a unique random number. This URL looks like `http://host/sympa/ticket/12345789`. When using this URL a new Sympa session is initialized. This session is trusted by Sympa as an authenticated web session. The email used is of course the same as the email used for the challenge. 

This is done via a new table : one\_time\_ticket\_table . This table is used for both storing the email that will applied to the session and for storing the web action that will be applied.
