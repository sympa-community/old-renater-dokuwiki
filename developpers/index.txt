====== Wished developments ======

===== Run Sympa in taint mode =====

It'll make Sympa more secure.

===== Reconstruct Message class =====

  * Currently this is thick wrapper of MIME::Entity object.  Messages are occasinally decoded to this object and encoded so that format may be changed.
    * Postpone MIME parsing to resolve difficulties on S/MIME or DKIM.
  * Introduce the field corresponding to list context.  For example, bulk mailer table had been supposed to have to store S/MIME private key because conext was unknown.  It is not true.  If Message object has context field, those keys may not be stored.
