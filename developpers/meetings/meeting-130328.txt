====== Sympa meeting 28th March 2013 ======

Meeting through Seevogh. Present: Ã‰tienne, Marc, Guillaume, David. Soji could not make it.

====== Roadmap ======

Here are the current orientations and deadlines for Sympa.

===== Sympa 6.2 =====

All in all, Sympa 6.2 is close to be ready. We still have to:

  * get rid of the "full spools in database" paradigm (it really doesn't scale),
  * get rid of some memory leaks.

and it will be over.

  * Works on the code are to be finished by mid-april 2013
  * Beta release is planned for beginning of may 2013

===== Sympa 6.3 =====

Sympa 6.3 will be the result of a code reorganization. It should not add new functionnalities (or only side benefits from the code reorganization and refactoring).

Work on the code is already started and will be over by the end of Summer 2013. Beta should start in September 2013.

Aim: having a reasonably modular code structure and coding conventions. Guillaume suggested to finish daemons refactoring.

===== Sympa 7.0 =====

Sympa 7.0 will introduce several features:

  * SaaS capabilities
  * Configuration homogeneization
  * RFC 6729 implementation

And more.

This version will be under development from Q4 2013 to Q2 2014. Beta released to be planned in Q2 2014.

===== Sympa versionning =====

  * We keep SVN for 6.2 stabilization
  * Once merge of 6.2 branch is done with sympa-clenup branch, we switch to git. This is planned for beginning of May 2013
  * Sympa authors from RENATER will deal with how to keep different branches in sync (pre-git and post-git era)
