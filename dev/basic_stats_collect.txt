We should gather conitnuously informations regarding a server activity.

===== What to store ? =====

==== Relevant informations ====

  * number of messages
  * number of subscribers
  * number of users
  * number of lists
  * number of subscriptions

===== Granularity =====

==== Time granularity ====

What is the minimum period relevant for information aggregation? We guess it would be the day.
We must store these data in the lowest granularity chosen.

==== Information granularity ====

What is the level to which aggregate? List? Robot? User?

===== How to store? =====

==== Data storage ====

We can store information in the database or in a file.

==== Tools ====

We must re-use the code of the db logs. Maybe we could directly aggregate the data collected in the db logs.

===== What to do with the data? =====

==== Export ====

As people will want to use statistics ASAP, we must be able, at least, to export them in CSV.

==== Tools ====

This functionality should be usable by other tools, such as Cacti.
