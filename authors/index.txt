[[authors:7.0|What we do in 7.0]]

===== Development discussed =====

Here is the list of topics currently discussed on the sympa-developpers mailing list.

==== Still undecided ====

  * May we shorten list of multiple years in copyright notice included into statement of GNU GPL in each source file?
    * cf. [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html|How to use GNU licenses for your own software]]

  * Would test suite use either perl -I option and FindBin gimmick or PERL5LIB environment variable?


==== Decided ====

  * Moving to Perl a higher version thant perl 5.8 => no

== a-20 ==

  * FIXME Sequence number occasionally doesn't update (numbers should be "1" (file 0000) to "4" (file 0003) but are "1", "1", "2" and "3", for example).
  * This seems to occur randomly and I don't reproduce it just as I want to.

== a-16 ==

  * FIXME LAST command notices archive is empty (it means list really exists) even if list is "confidential"

  * This issue was moved to bug tracker [[https://sourcesup.renater.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=9476&group_id=23&atid=167|#9476]].
