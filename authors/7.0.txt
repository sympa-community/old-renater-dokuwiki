====== Sympa 7.0 ======

===== Maintaining code base =====

  * Merge trunk and sympa-6.2-branch.
    * Former contains many reordering and clarifications, latter adds many bug fixes and some refactoring.
  * Switch to git.

===== Make it more modular =====

  * Refactoring on Site/Robot/Family/List.
  * Refactoring on Pipeline/Spool/Message etc.
    * This may be done on 6.2b.X
  * Splitting functions of sympa.pl and wwsympa.fcgi into the sets of pluggable scriptlets.
  * Reintroducing Markov's Sympa::Plugin interface.

===== Web interface improvments =====

  * Moving to Plack (Marc will work on it on a separate branch to see if it is a good move or not)
  * Improve interface look and feel :
    * remold all interface : 
      * change overall display and CSS to make Sympa look modern
      * think about what we need to dispaly. Shall we get rid of current menus to pinpoint only the most important features?
    * implement drag and drop in the shared documents
    * improve post through the web: add formatting and make the archives look more like a forum.

===== Postponed functions =====

  * ARF support
    * Though it had been done on sympa-6.2-branch-old, not have been added on (new) sympa-6.2-branch.
  * ...
