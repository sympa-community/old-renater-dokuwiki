This version mainly fixes several bugs related to list families management.

It also introduces a change related to LDAP: Default cryptographic protocol of LDAP over SSL/TLS became TLSv1. Note that SSLv2 and SSLv3 are no longer recommended due to their weakness.
The following default changes are introduced in Sympa to reflect this new defaults:
  - List config: The default of "ssl_version" parameters in "include_ldap" paragraph and so on became "tlsv1".
  - ldap_alias_manager.pl: New parameter "ldap_ssl_version" to specify protocol version which defaults to "tlsv1" was introduced.  On earlier releases it was fixed to "sslv3".

Tens of thousands users around the world can proudly say: "Yes, I use Sympa. It's easy because it's in [Put you own language here]".

Do you know why? That's because some people around here did spend some time translating Sympa. Doing so, they allowed a lot of people to feel the joy of open source. Coders create tools, indeed, but translators bring these tools to the world.

Did you never dream to be as cool as these guys?

Well, you can.

We use the Pootle translation tool, which allows you to easily edit online Sympa translation for your language. If you feel like contributing to Sympa but you don't like/know Perl, well spending a few minutes translating a few strings on this server is [[http://pootle.sympa.org/|the way to go]]!

New translations are added to the Sympa distribution each time we tag a new version.

Become a translator, people will love you!
