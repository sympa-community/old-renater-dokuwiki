This release includes mainly bug fixes.

A few changes were also made to Sympa. Some important points are:

  * Optimization for list search which, for very large server, could timeout and lead to an error on the web interface,
  * Password strength validation when submitted by user,
  * New, out-of-the-box DKIM-based scenarios,
  * improvment for scenarios custom_conditions: custom_condition can now return the type of action to take: owner, request_auth, etc. This allows complex, single-module CustomConditions.

Sympa 6.0.9 is a single patch release. It introduces the [[https://www.sympa.org/manual/dmarc|DMARC protection]] to the 6.0.9, helping listmasters fight the side effects of DMARC without having to upgrade to 6.1 (which we still strongly recommend ;-) )\\
