====== Sympa workshop ======

This workshop is co-organized by [[http://www.renater.fr/|RENATER]], [[http://www.terena.org/|TERENA]] and the [[http://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=homepage|Strasbourg university]]. Is is held at Strasbourg university, France, on 18th and 19th November 2013.

This is a technical workshop. Attendees will manipulate pre-installed Sympa server to experiment some of the major Sympa features.

===== Agenda =====

==== Day 1: 18th November, 13:00 - 18:00 ====

  - **Basic Sympa administration**: Discover the Sympa server and discover the basis of Sympa administration
  - **Messenging functionnalities**: Mailing lists mean mails, and mails mean a lot of different mechanisms to use and analyze: reception modes, loop prevention, alias management, error handling, etc.
  - **Authorization mechanism**: Sympa has an original authorization mechanism based on scenario, which allows to set a very fine granularity of authorization.
  - **Data sources for list subscribers**: Sympa is aimed at information system integration. It therefore allows to automatically populate lists with a number of external data sources: SQL, LDAP, files, etc.
  - **Virtual hosting**: You can run several lists domains with a single Sympa instance. Learn how to!

**Evening**: Let's have a small tour in Strasbourg and find some nice restaurant that can host us all (two restaurants, if we are too many)!

==== Day 2: 19th November, 09:00 - 12:00 ====

  - **DKIM**: Sympa implements DKIM for mailing lists. Learn more about this interesting anti-phishing mechanism.
  - **List creation industrialisation**: Manual creation works well when you don't have to create hundreds of lists every starting year. Sympa has several levels of increasingly automated mechanisms to create numerous lists
  - **Sympa as a group manager**: Through its web services, Sympa can propagate lists information to other applications. Coupled to the other automated lists management mechanism, Sympa can be a very usefull group manager for groupware tools.
