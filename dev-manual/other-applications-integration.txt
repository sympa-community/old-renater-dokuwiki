======  Sharing data with other applications ======

You may extract subscribers, owners and editors for a list from any of:

  * a text file;
  * a relational database;
  * a LDAP directory.

See the [[parameters-data-sources#user_data_source|user_data_source]] list parameter.

The three tables can have more fields than the one used by Sympa, by defining these additional fields, they will be available from within Sympa's authorization scenarios and templates (see [[conf-parameters#db_additional_subscriber_fields|db_additional_subscriber_fields]] and [[conf-parameters:part3#db_additional_user_fields|db_additional_user_fields]]).

See [[list-definition#data_inclusion_file|Data inclusion file]].

====== Subscriber count ======

The number of subscribers of a list can be obtained from an external application by requesting function ''subscriber_count'' on the Web interface.

Example: <code>http://my.server/wws/subscriber_count/mylist</code>
