====== Does Sympa alter messages? ======

Sympa receives incoming messages in its ''msg'' spool. An image of the message is then created (a MIME::Entity, using MIME-Tools CPAN library) for later processing. At the end, the MIME::Entity object is dumped to the mail tranfer agent (sendmail, postfix,...). Note that the message might be altered by this intermediate MIME::Entity object (row size for Base64 encoded MIME parts for example). The use of the MIME::Entity intermediate object is skipped is a message is S/MIME signed because any changes in any part of the message body would break the S/MIME signature. 

Note also that Sympa might perform the following changes to the distributed messages ;however some of this alterations of the messages can be configured :
  * SMTP header fields are added/removed for loop prevention (see [[customizing#loop_detection]]), for RFC 2369 compliance (see [[conf-parameters/part2#rfc2369_header_fields]]) or through customizations (see [[conf-parameters/part2#remove_headers]]).
  * the subject of the message might be changed to add a custom subject (see [[parameters-sending#custom_subject]])
  * Headers and footers may be added. They are either added as separate MIME parts or within the message body, if it is of text type (see [[list-definition#message_header_and_footer]])
  * Message content-type may be changed from multipart/alternative to text/plain or text/html if the user has selected the corresponding reception mode (see [[reception-mode#multipartalternative]])
