======  List parameters: definition ======

===== subject =====

''subject'' //subject-of-the-list//

This parameter indicates the subject of the list, which is sent in response to the ''LISTS'' mail command. The subject is a free form text limited to one line.

===== visibility =====

(Default value: ''conceal'')

The ''visibility'' parameter is defined by an authorization scenario (see [[authorization-scenarios|Authorization scenarios]]).

This parameter indicates whether the list should feature in the output generated in response to a ''LISTS'' command.

  * ''visibility'' ''conceal'' ([[http://www.sympa.org/distribution/current/src/etc/scenari/visibility.conceal|view]]) \\
  * ''visibility'' ''intranet'' ([[http://www.sympa.org/distribution/current/src/etc/scenari/visibility.intranet|view]]) \\
  * ''visibility'' ''noconceal'' ([[http://www.sympa.org/distribution/current/src/etc/scenari/visibility.noconceal|view]]) \\
  * ''visibility'' ''secret'' ([[http://www.sympa.org/distribution/current/src/etc/scenari/visibility.secret|view]]) \\


===== owner =====

The ''config'' file contains one ''owner'' paragraph per owner. It concerns static owner definition. For dynamic definition, see [[parameters-definition#owner_include|owner_include]].

Example:
<code>
  owner
  email serge.aumont@renater.fr
  gecos C.R.U.
  info Tel: 02 99 76 45 34
  reception nomail
</code>

The list owner is usually the person who has the authorization to send ''ADD'' and ''DELETE'' commands (see [[sympa-commands#owner_commands|Owner commands]]) on behalf of other users.

When the [[parameters-privileges#subscribe|subscribe parameter]] specifies a restricted list, it is the owner who has the exclusive right to subscribe users, and it is therefore to the owner that ''SUBSCRIBE'' requests will be forwarded.

There may be several owners of a single list; in this case, each owner is declared in a paragraph starting with the ''owner'' keyword.

The ''owner'' directive is followed by one or several lines giving details regarding the owner's characteristics:

  * ''email'' //address// \\  Owner's e-mail address;
  * ''reception nomail'' \\ Optional attribute for an owner who does not wish to receive emails. Useful to define an owner with multiple email addresses: they are all recognized when Sympa receives mail, but thanks to ''reception nomail'', not all of these addresses need to receive administrative email from Sympa;
  * ''visibility'' //conceal | noconceal// \\Define if the list owner should be listed on the list web page.
  * ''gecos'' //data// \\ Public information about the owner;
  * ''info'' //data// \\ Available since release 2.3. Private information about the owner;
  * ''profile privileged | normal'' \\ Available since release 2.3.5. Profile of the owner. This is currently used to restrict access to some features of //WWSympa//, such as adding new owners to a list.


===== owner_include =====

The ''config'' file contains one ''owner_include'' paragraph per data inclusion file (see [[list-definition#data_inclusion_file|Data inclusion file]]. It concerns dynamic owner definition: inclusion of external data. For static owner definition and more information about owners see [[list-parameters#par-owner|par-owner]].

Example:
<code>
  owner_include
  source myfile
  source_parameters a,b,c
  reception nomail
  profile normal
</code>

The ''owner_include'' directive is followed by one or several lines giving details regarding the owner(s) included characteristics:

  * ''source myfile'' \\ This is an mandatory field: it indicates the data inclusion file ''myfile.incl''. This file can be a template. In this case, it will be interpreted with values given by subparameter ''source_parameter''. Note that the ''source'' parameter should NOT include the //.incl// file extension; the ''myfile.incl'' file should be located in the ''data_sources'' directory.
  * ''source_parameters a,b,c'' \\ It contains an enumeration of the values that will be affected to the ''param'' array used in the template file (see [[list-definition#data_inclusion_file|Data inclusion file]]). This parameter is not mandatory.
  * ''reception nomail'' \\ Optional attribute for owner(s) who does not wish to receive emails.
  * ''visibility'' //conceal | noconceal// \\Define if the included owners should be listed on the list web page.
  * ''profile privileged | normal'' \\ Profile of the owner(s).

===== editor =====

The ''config'' file contains one ''editor'' paragraph per moderator (or editor). It concerns static editor definition. For dynamic definition and more information about editors see [[parameters-definition#editor_include|editor_include]].

Example:
<code>
  editor
  email Pierre.Paul@myuniversity.edu
  gecos Pierre paul (Computer center director)
</code>

Only the editor of a list is authorized to send messages to the list when the [[parameters-sending#send|send]] is set to either ''editor'', ''editorkey'', or ''editorkeyonly''. The ''editor'' parameter is also consulted in certain other cases (''privateoreditorkey'').

The syntax of this directive is the same as that of the [[parameters-definition#owner|owner parameter]], even when several moderators are defined.

===== editor_include =====

The ''config'' file contains one ''editor_include'' paragraph per data inclusion file (see [[list-definition#data_inclusion_file|Data inclusion file]]). It concerns dynamic editor definition: inclusion of external data. For static editor definition and more information about moderation see [[parameters-definition#editor|editor]].

Example:
<code>
  editor_include
  reception mail
  source myfile
  source_parameters a,b,c
</code>

The syntax of this directive is the same as that of the [[parameters-definition#owner_include|owner_include'' parameter]], even when several moderators are defined.

===== topics =====

''topics'' computing/internet,education/university

This parameter allows the classification of lists. You may define multiple topics as well as hierarchical ones. //WWSympa//'s list of public lists uses this parameter. This parameter is different from the ''msg_topic'' parameter used to tag emails.

===== host =====

(Default value: ''domain robot parameter'')

''host'' //fully-qualified-domain-name//

Domain name of the list, default is the robot domain name set in the related ''robot.conf'' file or in file ''/etc/sympa.conf''.

===== lang =====

(Default value: ''lang robot parameter'')

Example:

<code>lang en_US</code>

This parameter defines the language used for the list. It is used to initialize a user's language preference; Sympa command reports are extracted from the associated message catalog.

See [[customizing#internationalization|Internationalization]] for available languages.

===== family_name =====

This parameter indicates the name of the family that the list belongs to.

Example:

<code>family_name my_family</code>

===== latest_instantiation =====

This parameter indicates the date of the latest instantiation.

Example:
<code>
  latest_instantiation
  email joe.bar@renater.fr
  date 27 jui 2004 at 09:04:38
  date_epoch 1090911878
</code>
