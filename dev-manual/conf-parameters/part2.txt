====== sympa.conf parameters ======

======  Directories ======

===== home =====

(Default value: ''''/home/sympa/expl'''')

The directory whose subdirectories correspond to the different lists.

Example: home /home/sympa/expl

===== etc =====

(Default value: ''/home/sympa/etc'')

This is the local directory for configuration files (such as ''edit_list.conf''. It contains 5 subdirectories:
  * ''scenari'' for local authorization scenarios;
  * ''mail_tt2'' for the site's local mail templates and default list templates;
  * ''web_tt2'' for the site's local HTML templates;
  * ''global_task_models'' for local global task models;
  * ''list_task_models'' for local list task models.

Example: <code>etc /home/sympa/etc</code>

======  System related ======

===== syslog =====

(Default value: ''LOCAL1'')

Name of the sub-system (facility) for logging messages.

Example: <code>syslog LOCAL2</code>

===== log_level =====

(Default value: ''0'')

This parameter sets the verbosity of Sympa processes (including) in log files. With level ''0'' only main operations are logged, in level ''3'' almost everything is logged.

Example: <code>log_level 2</code>

===== log_module =====
(No default value)

If defined the related module will generate logs. This can be usefull because if you are using log_level you may generate huges logs files. See also log_condition.

Example: <code>log_module scenario,smtp</code>

  * scenario : if activing logs for scenario module, Sympa will log scenario evaluation rules by rules.
  * smtp : not yet implemented (should replace the option -m of sympa.pl

 ===== log_condition ===== 
(No default value)

If defined the log_module feature will be applied only if the specified condition is verified. This can be used on a production server with many users to collect logs in a limited context. 

Example: <code>log_condition ip=129.20.128.2,email=foo@domain</code>

In current Sympa version the only two implemented condition are ip and email where ip parameter is compared to the user agent ip address (usuable only on the web interface) and email is compared to the message From: header (mail interface) or the email used for login (web interface).
 

===== log_socket_type =====

(Default value: ''unix'')

Sympa communicates with ''syslogd'' using either UDP or UNIX sockets. Set ''log_socket_type'' to ''inet'' to use UDP, or ''unix'' for UNIX sockets.

===== pidfile =====

(Default value: ''/home/sympa/etc/sympa.pid'')

The file where the ''sympa.pl'' daemon stores its process number. Warning: the ''sympa'' user must be able to write to this file, and to create it if it does not exist.

Example: <code>pidfile /var/run/sympa.pid</code>

===== pidfile_creation =====

(Default value: ''/home/sympa/etc/sympa-creation.pid'')

The file where the automatic list creation dedicated ''sympa.pl'' daemon stores its process number. Warning: the ''sympa'' user must be able to write to this file, and to create it if it does not exist.

Example: <code>pidfile_creation /var/run/sympa-creation.pid</code>

===== umask =====

(Default value: ''027'')

Default mask for file creation (see umask). Note that it will be interpreted as an octual value.

Example: <code>umask 007</code>



====== Antispam related ======

===== antispam_feature =====

(Default value: ''off'')

This parameter turn on or off a set of antispam features. In order to use it you need some antispam filter engine (spamassassin, j-chkmail, mailscanner, ...) to be actived and messages to be tagued if they are suspected to be spams before to be spooled for Sympa. The following parameters are then used :
  * antispam_tag_header_name
  * antispam_tag_header_spam_regexp
  * antispam_tag_header_ham_regexp

Details on the spam managment are described on the section : [[../antispam]] 

The following example is for spamassassin filter :
<code>
antispam_feature on

antispam_tag_header_name X-Spam-Status

antispam_tag_header_spam_regexp Yes

antispam_tag_header_ham_regexp No

</code>

===== antispam_tag_header_name =====

The smtp header name used to specify the antispam result for each message.

Example : <code>X-Spam-Status</code>

===== antispam_tag_header_spam_regexp =====

The regexp applied on the specified header to recognize messages tagued as spam. 

Example : <code>Spam-Hi</code>


===== antispam_tag_header_ham_regexp =====

The regexp applied on the specified header to recognize messages tagued as ham. 

Example : <code>Ham</code>

======  Sending related ======

===== distribution_mode =====

(Default value: ''single'')

Use this parameter to determine whether your installation runs only one ''sympa.pl'' daemon that processes both messages to distribute and commands (single), or if ''sympa.pl'' will fork to run two separate processes, one dedicated to message distribution and one dedicated to commands and message pre-processing (fork). The second choice makes a better priority processing for message distribution and faster command response, but it requires a bit more computer resources.

Example: <code>distribution_mode fork</code>

===== maxsmtp =====

(Default value: ''20'')

Maximum number of SMTP delivery child processes spawned by Sympa. This is the main load control parameter : it prevents sympa.pl process from spawning too many sendmail child processes on the server.

Example: <code>maxsmtp 500</code>

===== log_smtp =====

(Default value: ''off'')

Set logging of each MTA call. Can be overwritten by ''-m'' sympa option.

Example: <code>log_smtp on</code>

===== use_blacklist =====

(Default value: ''send,create_list"'')

Sympa provides a blacklist feature available for list editors and owners. The ''use_blacklist'' parameter defines which operations use the blacklist. Search in blacklist is mainly useful for the ''send'' service (distribution of a message to the subscribers). You may use blacklist for other operations such as review, archive, etc., but be aware that those web services need fast response and blacklist may require some resources.

If you do not want blacklist at all, define ''use_blacklist'' to ''none'' so that the user interface to manage blacklist will disappear from the web interface.


===== max_size =====

(Default value: ''5 Mb'')

Maximum size (in bytes) allowed for messages distributed by Sympa. This may be customized per virtual host or per list by setting the ''max_size'' robot or list parameter.

Example: <code>max_size 2097152</code>

===== misaddressed_commands =====

(Default value: ''reject'')

When a robot command is sent to a list, by default Sympa rejects this message. This feature can be turned off setting this parameter to ignore.


===== misaddressed_commands_regexp =====

(Default value: ''(subscribe|unsubscribe|signoff)'')

This is the Perl regular expression applied on messages subject and body to detect misaddressed commands, see [[#misaddressed_commands|misaddressed_commands parameter]].



===== nrcpt =====

(Default value: ''25'')

Maximum number of recipients per ''sendmail'' call. This grouping factor makes it possible for the (''sendmail'') MTA to optimize the number of SMTP sessions for message distribution. If needed, you can limit the number of recipients for a particular domain. Check the ''nrcpt_by_domain'' configuration file (see [[../organization#nrcptbydomain|nrcpt_by_domain]]).


===== avg =====

(Default value: ''10'')

Maximum number of different Internet domains within addresses per ''sendmail'' call.



===== alias_manager =====

(Default value: ''/home/sympa/bin/alias_manager.pl'')

The absolute path to the script that will add/remove mail aliases, see [[manual:mail-aliases]]. 

Example: <code>alias_manager /home/sympa/bin/ldap_alias_manager.pl</code>

===== sendmail =====

(Default value: ''/usr/sbin/sendmail'')

Absolute path to SMTP message transfer agent binary. Sympa expects this binary to be sendmail compatible (postfix, Qmail and Exim binaries all provide sendmail compatibility).

Example: <code>sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail</code>

===== sendmail_args =====

(Default value: ''-oi -odi -oem'')

Arguments passed to the SMTP message transfer agent.

===== sendmail_aliases =====

(Default value: ''defined by makefile, sendmail_aliases | none'')

Path of the alias file that contains all list related aliases. It is recommended to create a specific alias file so that Sympa never overwrites the standard alias file, but only a dedicated file. You must refer to this aliases file in your ''sendmail.mc'': set this parameter to ''none'' if you want to disable alias management in Sympa (e.g. if you use ''virtual_transport'' with Postfix).

===== rfc2369_header_fields =====

(Default value: ''help,subscribe,unsubscribe,post,owner,archive'')

RFC2369 compliant header fields (List-xxx) to be added to distributed messages. These header fields should be implemented by MUA's, adding menus.

===== remove_headers =====

(Default value: ''Return-Receipt-To,Precedence,X-Sequence,Disposition-Notification-To'')

This is the list of SMTP headers fields that Sympa should remove from incoming messages. Use it, for example, to ensure some privacy for your users by discarding anonymous options. An equivalent parameter can be set in list configuration files. The removal of these header fields is applied before Sympa adds his own header fields (''rfc2369_header_fields'' and ''custom_header'').

Example: <code>remove_headers Resent-Date,Resent-From,Resent-To,Resent-Message-Id,Sender,Delivered-To"</code>


===== remove_outgoing_headers =====

(Default value: ''none'')

You can define a comma-separated list of SMTP header fields that you wish Sympa to remove from outgoing headers. An equivalent parameter can be set in list configuration files. The removal happens after Sympa's own header fields are added ; therefore, it is a convenient way to remove Sympa's own header fields (like ''X-Loop'' or ''X-No-Archive'') if you wish.

Example: <code>remove_outgoing_headers X-no-archive"</code>

===== ignore_x_no_archive_header_feature =====

(Default value: ''off'')

Sympa's default behavior is to skip archiving of incoming messages that have an ''X-no-archive'' SMTP header filed set. The ''ignore_x_no_archive_header_feature'' parameter allows to change this behavior.

Example: <code>gnore_x_no_archive_header_feature on</code>


===== anonymous_headers_fields =====

(Default value:\\ ''Sender,X-Sender,Received,Message-id,From,X-Envelope-To,Resent-From,Reply-To,Organization,Disposition-Notification-To,X-Envelope-From,X-X-Sender'')

This parameter defines the list of SMTP header fields that should be removed when a mailing list is setup in anonymous mode (see [[manual:parameters-sending#anonymous_sender|anonymous_sender]]).


===== list_check_smtp =====

(Default value: ''NONE'')

If this parameter is set with a SMTP server address, Sympa will check if alias with the same name as the list you are creating already exists on the SMTP server. It is robot specific, i.e. you can specify a different SMTP server for every virtual host you are running. This is needed if you are running Sympa on somehost.foo.org, but you handle all your mail on a separate mail relay.

===== list_check_suffixes =====

(Default value: ''request,owner,unsubscribe'')

This parameter is a comma-separated list of admin suffixes you are using for Sympa aliases, i.e. ''mylist-request'', ''mylist-owner'', etc. This parameter is used with the ''list_check_smtp'' parameter. It is also used to check list names at list creation time.

===== urlize_min_size =====

(Default value: ''10240'')

This parameter is related to the ''URLIZE'' subscriber delivery mode; it defines the minimum size (in bytes) for MIME attachments to be urlized.

====== Quotas ======

===== default_shared_quota =====

The default disk quota (the unit is Kbytes) for lists' document repositories.

===== default_archive_quota =====

(Default value: ''/home/sympa/spool/bounce'')

Spool to store bounces (non-delivery reports) received by the ''bouncequeue'' program via the ''mylist-owner'' (unless this suffix was customized) or ''bounce+*'' addresses (VERP) . This parameter is mandatory and must be an absolute path.

===== queuetask =====

(Default value: ''/home/sympa/spool/task'')

Spool to store task files created by the task manager. This parameter is mandatory and must be an absolute path.

===== queueautomatic =====

(Default value: ''none'')

The absolute path of the directory which contains the queue for automatic list creation, used by both the ''familyqueue'' program and the ''sympa.pl'' daemon. This parameter is mandatory when enabling ''automatic_list_creation''.

Example: <code>clean_delay_queue 3</code>

===== clean_delay_queueoutgoing =====

(Default value: ''1'')

Retention period (in days) for "bad" messages in the outgoing spool (as specified by ''[[#queueoutgoing|queueoutgoing]]'').
