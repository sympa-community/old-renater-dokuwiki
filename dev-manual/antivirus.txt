====== Antivirus ======

Sympa lets you use an external antivirus solution to check incoming mails. In this case you must set the ''antivirus_path'' and ''antivirus_args'' configuration parameters (see [[conf-parameters#Antivirus_plug-in|Antivirus_plug-in]]. Sympa is already compatible with McAfee/uvscan, Fsecure/fsav, Sophos, AVP, Trend Micro/VirusWall and Clam Antivirus. For each email received, Sympa extracts its MIME parts in the ''/home/sympa/spool/tmp/antivirus'' directory and then calls the antivirus software to check them. When a virus is detected, Sympa looks for the virus name in the virus scanner STDOUT and sends a ''your_infected_msg.tt2'' warning to the sender of the email. The dmail is saved as 'bad' and the working directory is deleted (except if Sympa is running in debug mode).
