====== Authentication ======

Sympa needs to authenticate users (subscribers, owners, moderators, listmasters) on both its mail and web interface, and then apply appropriate privileges (authorization process) to subsequent requested actions. Sympa is able to cope with multiple authentication means on the client side, and when using user+password, it can validate these credentials against LDAP authentication backends.

When contacted on the mail interface, Sympa has 3 authentication levels. Lower level is to trust the ''From:'' SMTP header field. A higher level of authentication will require that the user confirms his/her message. The strongest supported authentication method is S/MIME (note that Sympa also deals with S/MIME encrypted messages).

On the Sympa web interface (//WWSympa//) the user can authenticate in 4 different ways (if appropriate setup has been done on the Sympa server). Default authentication is performed through the user's email address and a password managed by Sympa itself. If an LDAP authentication backend (or multiple) has been defined, then the user can authenticate with his/her LDAP uid and password. Sympa is also able to delegate the authentication job to a web Single SignOn system; currently [[http://www.yale.edu/tp/auth/|CAS]] (the Yale University system) or a generic SSO setup, adapted to SSO products providing an Apache module. When contacted via HTTPS, Sympa can make use of X509 client certificates to authenticate users.

The authorization process in Sympa (authorization scenarios) refers to authentication methods. The same authorization scenarios are used for both mail and web accesss; therefore some authentication methods are considered to be equivalent: mail confirmation (on the mail interface) is equivalent to password authentication (on the web interface); S/MIME authentication is equivalent to HTTPS with client certificate authentication. Each rule in authorization scenarios requires an authentication method (''smtp'', ''md5'' or ''smime''); if the required authentication method was not used, a higher authentication mode can be requested.




======  S/MIME and HTTPS authentication ======

Chapter [[x509#use_of_smime_signatures_by_sympa_itself|Use of S/MIME signature by Sympa itself]] deals with Sympa and S/MIME signature. Sympa uses the ''OpenSSL'' library to work on S/MIME messages, you need to configure some related Sympa parameters: [[x509#ssympa_configuration|S/X509 Sympa configuration]].

Sympa HTTPS authentication is based on Apache+mod_SSL that provide the required authentication information through CGI environment variables. You will need to edit the Apache configuration to allow HTTPS access and require X509 client certificate. Here is a sample Apache configuration:

<code>
  SSLEngine on
  SSLVerifyClient optional
  SSLVerifyDepth  10
  ...
  <Location /sympa>
     SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
     SetHandler fastcgi-script
  </Location>
</code>

If you are using the SubjAltName, then you additionaly need to export the certificate data because of a ''mod_ssl'' bug. You will also need to install the textindex Crypt-OpenSSL-X509 CPAN module. Add this option to the Apache configuration file: <code>SSLOptions +ExportCertData</code>


====== Authentication with email address, uid or alternate email address ======

Sympa stores the data relative to the subscribers in a DataBase. Among these data: password, email address exploited during the web authentication. The module of LDAP authentication allows to use Sympa in an intranet without duplicating user passwords.

This way users can indifferently authenticate with their ''ldap_uid'', their ''alternate_email'' or their canonic email stored in the LDAP directory.

Sympa gets the canonic email in the LDAP directory with the ''ldap_uid'' or the ''alternate_email''. Sympa will first attempt an anonymous bind to the directory to get the user's DN, then Sympa will bind with the DN and the user's ''ldap_password'' in order to perform an efficient authentication. This last bind will work only if the right ''ldap_password'' is provided. Indeed the value returned by the bind(DN,ldap_password) is tested.

Example: a person is described by

                   Dn:cn=Fabrice Rafart,
                   ou=Siege ,
                   o=MyCompany,
                   c=FR Objectclass:
                   person Cn: Fabrice Rafart
                   Title: Network Responsible
                   O: Siege
                   Or: Data processing
                   Telephonenumber: 01-00-00-00-00
                   Facsimiletelephonenumber:01-00-00-00-00
                   L:Paris
                   Country: France
  		       uid: frafart
   		       mail: Fabrice.Rafart@MyCompany.fr
                   alternate_email: frafart@MyCompany.fr
                   alternate:rafart@MyCompany.fr

So Fabrice Rafart can be authenticated with: frafart, Fabrice.Rafart@MyCompany.fr, frafart@MyCompany.fr, Rafart@MyCompany.fr. After this operation, the address in the FROM field will be the Canonic email, in this case Fabrice.Rafart@MyCompany.fr. That means that Sympa will get this email and use it during all the session until you clearly ask Sympa to change your email address via the two pages: which and pref.




====== Generic SSO authentication ======

The authentication method has first been introduced to allow interraction with [[http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/|Shibboleth]], Internet2's inter-institutional authentication system. But it should be usable with any SSO system that provides an Apache authentication module being able to protect a specified URL on the site (not the whole site). Here is a sample ''httpd.conf'' that shib-protects the associated Sympa URL:

<code>
  ...
  <Location /sympa/sso_login/inqueue>
    AuthType shibboleth
    require mail ~ @
  </Location>
  ...
</code>

Sympa will get user attributes via environment variables. In the most simple case, the SSO will provide the user email address. If not, Sympa can be configured to check an email address provided by the user, or to look for the user email address in a LDAP directory (the search filter will make use of user information inherited from the SSO Apache module).

To plug a new SSO server in your Sympa server, you should add a ''generic_sso'' paragraph (describing the SSO service) in your ''auth.conf'' configuration file (see [[authentication#generic_sso_paragraph|generic_sso paragraph]]). Once this paragraph has been added, the SSO service name will be automatically added to the web login menu.

Apart from the user email address, the SSO can provide other user attributes that Sympa will store in the ''user_table'' DB table (for persistancy), and make available in the [user_attributes] structure that you can use within authorization scenarios (see [[authorization-scenarios#rules_specifications|Rules specifications]]) or in web templates via the [% user.attributes %] structure.


====== CAS-based authentication ======

CAS is the Yale University SSO software. Sympa can use the CAS authentication service.

Listmasters should define at least one or more CAS servers (**cas** paragraph) in ''auth.conf''. If the ''non_blocking_redirection'' parameter was set for a CAS server, then Sympa will try a transparent login on this server when the user accesses the web interface. If a CAS server redirects the user to Sympa with a valid ticket, Sympa receives a user ID from the CAS server. Then, it connects to the related LDAP directory to get the user email address. If no CAS server returns a valid user ID, Sympa will let the user either select a CAS server to login or perform a Sympa login.


====== auth.conf ======

The ''/home/sympa/etc/auth.conf'' configuration file contains numerous parameters which are read on start-up of Sympa. If you change this file, do not forget that you will need to restart ''wwsympa.fcgi'' afterwards.

The ''/home/sympa/etc/auth.conf'' is organized in paragraphs. Each paragraph describes an authentication service with all parameters required to perform an authentication using this service. Sympa's current version can perform authentication through LDAP directories, using an external Single Sign-On Service (like CAS or Shibboleth), or using the internal ''user_table'' table.

The login page contains 2 forms: the login form and the SSO. When users hit the login form, each ldap or ''user_table'' authentication paragraph is applied unless email adress input from form matches the ''negative_regexp'' or do not match ''regexp''. ''negative_regexp'' and ''regexp'' can be defined for each ldap or ''user_table'' authentication service so that administrators can block some authentication methods for a class of users.

The second form in the login page contains the list of CAS servers so that users can choose explicitely their CAS service.

Each paragraph starts with one of the keyword ''cas'', ''ldap'' or ''user_table''.

The ''/home/sympa/etc/auth.conf'' file contains directives in the following format:

<code>
paragraphs
keyword value

paragraphs
keyword value
</code>

Comments start with the ''#'' character at the beginning of a line.

Empty lines are also considered as comments and are ignored at the beginning. After the first paragraph, they are considered as paragraph separators. There should only be one directive per line, but their order in the paragraph is of no importance.

Example:
<code>
  #Configuration file auth.conf for the LDAP authentification
  #Description of parameters for each directory
  
  cas
  	base_url			https://sso-cas.renater.fr
  	non_blocking_redirection        on
  	auth_service_name		cas-cru

  	ldap_timeout			7
  	ldap_suffix			dc=cru,dc=fr
  	ldap_scope			sub
  	ldap_email_attribute		mail
  
  ## The URL corresponding to the service_id should be protected by the SSO (Shibboleth in the exampl)
  ## The URL would look like http://yourhost.yourdomain/sympa/sso_login/inqueue in the following example

          service_name       Authenticate with the CRU federation

=====  user_table paragraph =====

The ''user_table'' paragraph is related to Sympa internal authentication by email and password. It is the simplest one. The only parameters are ''regexp'' or ''negative_regexp'' which are Perl regular expressions applied on an email address provided, to select or block this authentication method for a subset of email addresses.





=====  ldap paragraph =====

  * ''regexp'' and ''negative_regexp'' \\ Same as in the ''user_table'' paragraph: if an email address is provided (this does not apply to an uid), then the regular expression will be applied to find out if the LDAP directory can be used to authenticate a subset of users.
  * ''host'' \\ This keyword is **mandatory**. It is the domain name used in order to bind to the directory and then to extract information. You must mention the port number after the server name. Server replication is supported by listing several servers separated by commas. \\ Example:
<code>
    	host ldap.univ-rennes1.fr:389
    	host ldap0.university.com:389,ldap1.university.com:389,ldap2.university.com:389
</code>
  * ''timeout'' \\ It corresponds to the timelimit in the Search fonction. A timelimit that restricts the maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a search. A value of 0 (the default) means that no timelimit will be requested.
  * ''suffix'' \\ The root of the DIT (Directory Information Tree). The DN that is the base object entry relative to which the search is to be performed. \\ Example: ''dc=university,dc=fr''
  * ''bind_dn'' \\ If anonymous bind is not allowed on the LDAP server, a DN and password can be used.
  * ''bind_password'' \\ This password is used, combined with the ''bind_dn'' above.
  * ''get_dn_by_uid_filter'' \\ Defines the search filter corresponding to the ''ldap_uid''. (RFC 2254 compliant). If you want to apply the filter on the user, use the variable ' [sender] '. It will work with every type of authentication (uid, ''alternate_email'', ...). \\ Example:
<code>
 	(Login = [sender])
    	(|(ID = [sender])(UID = [sender]))
</code>
  * ''get_dn_by_email_filter'' \\ Defines the search filter corresponding to the email addresses (canonic and alternative - this is RFC 2254 compliant). If you want to apply the filter on the user, use the variable ' [sender] '. It will work with every type of authentication (''uid'', ''alternate_email''..). \\ Example: a person is described by
<code>
  Dn:cn=Fabrice Rafart,
  ou=Siege ,
  o=MaSociete ,
  c=FR Objectclass:
  person Cn: Fabrice Rafart
  Title: Network Responsible
  O: Siege
  Or: Data processing
  Telephonenumber: 01-00-00-00-00
  Facsimiletelephonenumber:01-00-00-00-00
  L:Paris
  Country: France
  uid: frafart
  mail: Fabrice.Rafart@MaSociete.fr
  alternate_email: frafart@MaSociete.fr
  alternate:rafart@MaSociete.fr
</code> \\ The filters can be:
<code>
  (mail = [sender]) (| (mail = [sender])(alternate_email = [sender]) )
  (| (mail = [sender])(alternate_email = [sender])(alternate  = [sender]) )
</code>
  * ''email_attribute'' \\ The name of the attribute for the canonic email in your directory: for instance ''mail'', ''canonic_email'', ''canonic_address'', ... In the previous example, the canonic email is ''mail''.
  * ''alternative_email_attribute'' \\ The name of the attribute for the alternate email in your directory: for instance ''alternate_email'', ''mailalternateaddress'', ... You make a list of these attributes separated by commas.

With this list, Sympa creates a cookie which contains various information: whether the user is authenticated via LDAP or not, his alternate email. Storing the alternate email is interesting when you want to canonify your preferences and subscriptions, that is to say you want to use a unique address in ''user_table'' and ''subscriber_table'', which is the canonic email.
  * ''scope''  (Default value: ''sub'') \\ By default, the search is performed on the whole tree below the specified base object. This may be changed by specifying a scope:
    * ''base'': search only the base object,
    * ''one'': search the entries immediately below the base object,
    * ''sub'': search the whole tree below the base object. This is the default.
  * ''authentication_info_url'' \\ Defines the URL of a document describing LDAP password management. When hitting Sympa's //Send me a password// button, LDAP users will be redirected to this URL.
  * ''use_ssl'' \\ If set to ''1'', connection to the LDAP server will use SSL (LDAPS).
  * ''ssl_version'' \\ This defines the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use. Defaults of Net::LDAPS to ''sslv2/3'', other possible values are ''sslv2'', ''sslv3'', and ''tlsv1''.
  * ssl_ciphers
Specify which subset of cipher suites are permissible for this connection, using the standard OpenSSL string format. The default value of Net::LDAPS for ciphers is ''ALL'', which permits all ciphers, even those that do not encrypt!

===== generic_sso paragraph =====

  * ''service_name'' \\  This is the SSO service name that will be offered to the user in the login banner menu.
  * ''service_id'' \\  This service ID is used as a parameter by Sympa to refer to the SSO service (instead of the service name). \\ A corresponding URL on the local web server should be protected by the SSO system; this URL would look like ''<nowiki>http://yourhost.yourdomain/sympa/sso_login/inqueue</nowiki>'' if the ''service_id'' is ''inqueue''.
  * ''http_header_prefix'' \\  Sympa gets user attributes from environment variables coming from the web server. These variables are then stored in the ''user_table'' DB table for later use in authorization scenarios (in structure). Only environment variables starting with the defined prefix will be kept.
  * ''email_http_header'' \\  This parameter defines the environment variable that will contain the authenticated user's email address.
  * ''logout_url'' \\ This optional parameter allows to specify the SSO logout URL. If defined, Sympa will redirect the user to this URL after the Sympa logout has been performed.


The following parameters define how Sympa can check the user email address, either provided by the SSO or by the user himself:

  * ''internal_email_by_netid'' \\  If set to ''1'', this parameter makes Sympa use its ''netidmap'' table to associate NetIDs to user email addresses.
  * ''netid_http_header'' \\  This parameter defines the environment variable that will contain the user's identifier. This netid will then be associated with an email address provided by the user.
  * ''force_email_verify'' \\  If set to ''1'', this parameter makes Sympa check the user's email address. If the email address was not provided by the authentication module, then the user is requested to provide a valid email address.

The following parameters define how Sympa can retrieve the user email address; **these are useful only in case the ''email_http_header'' entry was not defined:**

  * ''ldap_host'' \\  The LDAP host Sympa will connect to fetch user email. The ''ldap_host'' include the port number and it may be a comma separated list of redondant hosts.
  * ''ldap_bind_dn'' \\  The DN used to bind to this server. Anonymous bind is used if this parameter is not defined.
  * ''ldap_bind_password'' \\  The password used unless anonymous bind is used.
  * ''ldap_suffix'' \\  The LDAP suffix used when searching user email.
  * ''ldap_scope'' \\  The scope used when searching user email. Possible values are ''sub'', ''base'' and ''one''.
  * ''ldap_get_email_by_uid_filter'' \\ The filter used to perform the email search. It can refer to any environment variables inherited from the SSO module, as shown below. Example: <code>ldap_get_email_by_uid_filter    (mail=[SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_Email])</code>
  * ''ldap_email_attribute'' \\ The attribute name to be used as user canonical email. In the current version of Sympa, only the first value returned by the LDAP server is used.
  * ''ldap_timeout'' \\  The time out for the search.
  * ''ldap_use_ssl'' \\ If set to ''1'', connection to the LDAP server will use SSL (LDAPS).
  * ''ldap_ssl_version'' \\ This defines the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use. Defaults of Net::LDAPS to ''sslv2/3'', other possible values are ''sslv2'', ''sslv3'', and ''tlsv1''.
  * ''ldap_ssl_ciphers'' \\ Specifies which subset of cipher suites are permissible for this connection, using the OpenSSL string format. The default value of Net::LDAPS for ciphers is ''ALL'', which permits all ciphers, even those that do not encrypt!




=====  cas paragraph =====

Note that Sympa will act as a CAS client to validate CAS tickets. During this exchange, Sympa will check the CAS server x.509 certificate. Therefore you should ensure that the certificate autority of the CAS server is known by Sympa ; this should be configured through the [[manual:conf-parameters:part3#cafile|cafile]] or [[manual:conf-parameters:part3#capath|capath]] sympa.conf configuration parameters.

  * ''auth_service_name'' \\  The friendly user service name as shown by Sympa in the login page.
  * ''host'' (OBSOLETE) \\  This parameter has been replaced by **base_url** parameter
  * ''base_url'' \\ The base URL of the CAS server.
  * ''non_blocking_redirection'' \\ This parameter only concerns the first access to Sympa services by a user, it activates or not the non blocking redirection to the related CAS server to check automatically if the user as been previously authenticated with this CAS server. Possible values are ''on'' and ''off'', default is ''on''. The redirection to CAS is used with the CGI parameter ''gateway=1'' that specifies to CAS server to always redirect the user to the original URL, but just check if the user is logged. If active, the SSO service is effective and transparent, but in case the CAS server is out of order, the access to Sympa services is impossible.
  * ''login_uri'' (OBSOLETE) \\  This parameter has been replaced by the ''login_path'' parameter.
  * ''login_path'' (OPTIONAL) \\  The login service path.
  * ''check_uri'' (OBSOLETE) \\  This parameter has been replaced by the ''service_validate_path'' parameter.
  * ''service_validate_path'' (OPTIONAL) \\  The ticket validation service path.
  * ''logout_uri'' (OBSOLETE) \\  This parameter has been replaced by the ''logout_path'' parameter.
  * ''logout_path'' (OPTIONAL) \\  The logout service path.
  * ''proxy_path'' (OPTIONAL) \\  The proxy service path, only used by the Sympa SOAP server.
  * ''proxy_validate_path'' (OPTIONAL) \\  The proxy validate service path, only used by the Sympa SOAP server.
  * ''ldap_host'' \\  The LDAP host Sympa will connect to fetch user email when user uid is return by CAS service. The ''ldap_host'' includes the port number and it may be a comma separated list of redondant hosts.
  * ''ldap_bind_dn'' \\  The DN used to bind to this server. Anonymous bind is used if this parameter is not defined.
  * ''ldap_bind_password'' \\  The password used unless anonymous bind is used.
  * ''ldap_suffix'' \\  The LDAP suffix used when searching user email.
  * ''ldap_scope'' \\  The scope used when searching user email. Possible values are ''sub'', ''base'' and ''one''.
  * ''ldap_get_email_by_uid_filter'' \\  The filter used to perform the email search.
  * ''ldap_email_attribute'' \\  The attribute name to be used as user canonical email. In the current version of Sympa, only the first value returned by the LDAP server is used.
  * ''ldap_timeout'' \\  The time out for the search.
  * ''ldap_use_ssl'' \\ If set to ''1'', connection to the LDAP server will use SSL (LDAPS).
  * ''ldap_ssl_version'' \\ This defines the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use. Defaults of Net::LDAPS to ''sslv2/3'', other possible values are ''sslv2'', ''sslv3'', and ''tlsv1''.
  * ''ldap_ssl_ciphers'' \\ Specifies which subset of cipher suites are permissible for this connection, using the OpenSSL string format. The default value of Net::LDAPS for ciphers is ''ALL'', which permits all ciphers, even those that do not encrypt!



====== Sharing WWSympa's authentication with other applications ======

If you are not using a web Single Sign On system, you might want to make other web applications collaborate with Sympa and share the same authentication system. Sympa uses HTTP cookies to carry users' authentication information from page to page. This cookie contains no information about privileges. To make your application work with Sympa, you have two possibilities:

  * Delegating authentication operations to //WWSympa//\\  If you want to avoid spending a lot of time programming a CGI to do Login, Logout and Remindpassword, you can copy //WWSympa//'s login page to your application, and then make use of the cookie information within your application. The cookie format is: <code>sympauser=<user_email>:<checksum></code>where ''<user_email>'' is the user's complete e-mail address, and ''<checksum>'' represents the 8 last bytes of the MD5 checksum of the ''<user_email>''+Sympa ''cookie'' configuration parameter. Your application needs to know what the ''cookie'' parameter is, so it can check the HTTP cookie validity; this is a secret shared between //WWSympa// and your application. //WWSympa//'s ''loginrequest'' page can be called to return to the referer URL when an action is performed. Here is a sample HTML anchor:<code><A HREF=''/sympa/loginrequest/referer''>Login page</A></code>
You can also have your own HTML page submitting data to ''wwsympa.fcgi'' CGI. If you do so, you can set the ''referer'' variable to another URI. You can also set the ''failure_referer'' to make //WWSympa// redirect the client to a different URI if login fails.
  * Using //WWSympa//'s HTTP cookie format within your authentication module \\ To cooperate with //WWSympa//, you simply need to adopt its HTTP cookie format and share the secret it uses to generate MD5 checksums, i.e. the ''cookie'' configuration parameter. In this way, //WWSympa// will accept users authenticated through your application without further authentication.


====== Provide a Sympa login form in another application ======

You can easily trigger a Sympa login from another web page. The login form should look like this:

<code>
  <FORM ACTION=''http://listes.renater.fr/sympa'' method=''post''>
        <input type=''hidden'' name=''previous_action'' value=''arc'' />
        Access web archives of list
        <select name=''previous_list''>
        <option value=''sympa-users'' >sympa-users</option>
        </select><br/>
        <input type=''hidden'' name=''action'' value=''login'' />
        <label for=''email''>email address:
        <input type=''text'' name=''email'' id=''email'' size=''18'' value='''' /></label><br />
        <label for=''passwd'' >password:
        <input type=''password'' name=''passwd'' id=''passwd'' size=''8'' /></label> <br/>
        <input class=''MainMenuLinks'' type=''submit'' name=''action_login'' value="Login and access web archives" />
  </FORM>
</code>

The example above does not only perform the login action, but also redirects the user to another Sympa page, a list web archive here. The ''previous_action'' and ''previous_list'' variables define the action that will be performed after the login is done.
