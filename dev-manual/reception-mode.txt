======  Message topics ======

A list can be configured to have message topics (this notion is different from topics used to class mailing lists). Users can subscribe to these message topics in order to receive a subset of distributed messages: a message can have one or more topics and subscribers will receive only messages that have been tagged with a topic they are subscribed to. A message can be tagged automatically, by the message sender or by the list moderator.

=====  Message topic definition in a list =====

Available message topics are defined by list parameters. For each new message topic, create a new ''msg_topic'' paragraph that defines the name and the title of the topic. If a thread is identified for the current message, then the automatic procedure is performed. Otherwise, to use automatic tagging, you should define keywords (see [[parameters-sending#msg_topic|msg_topic]]). To define which part of the message is used for automatic tagging, you have to define the ''msg_topic_keywords_apply_on'' list parameter (see [[parameters-sending#msg_topic_keywords_apply_on|msg_topic_keywords_apply_on]]). Tagging a message can be optional or required, depending on the [[parameters-sending#msg_topic_tagging list parameter]].

=====  Subscribing to message topics for list subscribers =====

This feature is only available with the ''normal'' delivery mode. Subscribers can select a message topic to receive messages tagged with this topic. To receive messages that were not tagged, users can subscribe to the topic ''other''. The message topics selected by a subscriber are stored in the Sympa database (''subscriber_table'' table).

=====  Message tagging =====

First of all, if one or more ''msg_topic.keywords'' are defined, Sympa tries to tag messages automatically. To trigger manual tagging, by message sender or list moderator, on the web interface, Sympa uses authorization scenarios: if the resulting action is ''editorkey'' (for example in scenario ''send.editorkey''), the list moderator is asked to tag the message. If the resulted action is ''request_auth'' (for example in scenario ''send.privatekey''), the message sender is asked to tag the message. The following variables are available as scenario variables to customize tagging: ''topic'', ''topic-sender'', ''topic-editor'', ''topic-auto'', ''topic-needed'' (see [[authorization-scenarios#authorization_scenarios|Authorization scenarios]]). If message tagging is required and if it was not yet performed, Sympa will ask the list moderator.

Tagging a message will create a topic information file in the ''/home/sympa/spool/topic/'' spool. Its name is based on the listname and the Message-ID. For message distribution, a ''X-Sympa-Topic'' field is added to the message, to allow members to use email filters.

====== Multipart/alternative ======

If available, list members can select the **TXT** or **HTML** reception modes. In these modes, the list member will receive the selected version of a message if the message's content-type is multipart/alternative.
