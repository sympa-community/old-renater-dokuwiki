===== All messages are lost =====
When I install sympa, it looks well, and goes correctly on. 
But it does absolutely nothing : with -d option, I just see
Reaper unwaited pids : 
Open = 0
ad infinitum
and no messages adressed to sympa seems to come in. The messages are
not even in the spool/msg directory. 

Solution : verify the **setuid bit** on program queue : 
  rwsr-xr-x   1 sympa    sympa      40012 juin 30 15:44 queue
   

Explanation : you probably (and prudently) compile and install sympa
as a normal user (sympa perhaps ? ), but user root is the only one 
authorized to modify setuid bit. You may compile with a normal account, 
but don't forget to modify  manually the setuid bit on $sympa/bin/queue

===== Note about the Sendmail "smrsh" feature =====

Remember that if your implementation uses the smrsh facility, the setuid
executables such as ''queue'' and ''bouncequeue'' will be in the special smrsh
directory (often ''/etc/smrsh''). You will need to apply the setuid bit to
the files in this directory and not the files with the same name in 
''/home/sympa/bin''. See **man smrsh** for more info.
