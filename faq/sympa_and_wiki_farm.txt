====== Sympa and Dokuwiki farm integration for Virtual Organizations ======

===== ...In a nutshell =====
A virtual organization is a geographically distributed group of people.\\
They need to:
  *Broadcast information to all the members of the organization
  *Share and collaboratively conceive reference documents

The system allows to provide these two functionnalities based on:
  *a single sign on (Shibboleth)
  *a single group manager (Sympa)

===== Authentication and access control =====
Both Dokuwiki and Sympa use Shibboleth authenticate system. Users authenticate at their home institution.\\
Access rights in Dokuwiki are based on membership of groups defined in Sympa: the lists subscribers and owners.

===== Automatic wiki creation in Sympa list interface =====

Dokuwiki is used in farm mode: **one installation allows to create multiple wiki instances.** \\
Each list owner can create a wiki associated to his/her list by a single click.
