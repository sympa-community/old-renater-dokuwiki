====== Is it possible to merge 2 Sympa servers? How? ======

Yes it is.
Actually, it is more "moving a Sympa server //into// another Sympa server" but the result is the same: one server stands where two stood before.



===== Merging in a nutshell =====

Let's call "immigrant server" the one that will be moved; and "host server" the one that will receive the immigrant.

When merging two servers, you have two options:

  * either you keep two separate list services (two virtual robots) running on one Sympa server (the lists have addresses with different domains);
  * or you want to have only one list service (one virtual robot) which will deal with all the lists, in which case the addresses will only differ by their local part.

The merging will need few or even no changes in the immigrant server //if// it is installed as a virtual robot in the host server.

The question is then: do you want to keep two separate list services on one Sympa server (easy) or do you prefer one robot processing all your lists (less easy)?

Once your choice is made, you're all set to start merging your servers.

These are the main guidelines to follow:

  - merge ''user_table'' tables from both servers. DON'T DO IT RIGHT NOW. READ THE SECTION ABOUT USERS BELOW FIRST.
  - transfer list directories from the immigrant server to the host.
  - compare and update ''sympa.conf'' and ''wwsympa.conf''.
  - update scenarios and templates.
  - restart Sympa.

Let's see now the detail of some operations.

===== Users migration =====

In order to merge your servers, you must merge the ''user_table'' tables from both servers. A close look at this table will reveal you the absence of any "robot" column. Which means all the user informations (as for example their language preferences) are not robot-dependent. This isn't a problem as all these informations are optional.

//However//, there can be an issue with the passwords.

Passwords are ciphered. It is a reversable encryption using the ''[[../manual/conf-parameters/part1#cookie|cookie]]'' parameter in ''sympa.conf''. This parameter is **not** robot-specific. Therefore, if you want to preserve the users' passwords from the immigrant server, you will have to:
  - decipher them using the immigrant server's ''cookie'' parameter and
  - recipher them with the host server's ''cookie'' parameter.

To achieve this goal, you will probably have to implement the following script:
  * Stop all the Sympa processes
  * Backup your database
  * Extract all the data from the immigrant server's ''table_user'' table.
  * FOR each line:
    * IF it doesn't exist in the host server's ''table_user'' table
      * decipher the ''password_user'' field using the immigrant server's ''cookie'' parameter
      * cipher it using the host server's ''cookie'' parameter
      * insert this line into the host server's ''table_user'' table
    * ELSE : do nothing

To cipher / decipher the password, you can seek inspiration in the ''crypt_password'' and ''decrypt_password'' procedures in ''tools.pl''

FIXMEune autre option est de faire l'impasse sur les mots de passe et les préférences utilisateur et de ne pas faire de merge des tables table_user.

===== Mailing list migration =====

**First**, copy these lists directories (those in ''list_data/'') from the immigrant server to the host server. This creates empty mailing lists in the host server.

**Then** replenish them by applying the ''load_subscribers.pl'' script. This -- undocumented ;-) -- script copy into the database the informations found in ''<list_data>/<listname>/subscribers'', where ''<listname>'' is the script's argument.

**Finally**, examine the ''table_subscriber'' to check that everything went well.

**Don't forget** to copy the ''spool/<listname>'' an ''arc/<listname>'' directories. If the lists' addresses changed, you must modify, in spools, the files name and their ''X-Sympa-To:'' header.

===== Additional tunings =====

Compare ''sympa.conf'' and ''wwsympa.conf'' in both immigrant and host servers. Some obvious choices must be made there.

If you cusomized some scenarios or templates, don't forget to install them into the host server.
