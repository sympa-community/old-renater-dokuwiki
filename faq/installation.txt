==== Supported OS ? ====

Sympa can run on any unix operating system including linux, solaris, mac-os, free-bsd, ... Prerequisite are described in detail in Sympa reference manual.

==== Why is the latest version not available as binary package ? ====

Sympa authors do not themselves produce binary packages for any system (.rpm, .deb). The packages you can find from [[http://www.sympa.org/linux.html]] are contributions, as there is always some delay before a version is available as binary package. 


==== Should I install a package or use the tar.gz source distrib ? ====
 
Sympa installation is known as long job. In fact this not really true : the installation itself is simple (./configure; make; make install) but there is a lot of configuration work in order to plug Sympa in with other services : Perl, RDBMS, syslog, sendmail, Apache, ...
Later upgrade processes are really fast and simple because all those items running don't need to be modified. As a conclusion: what ever you are using, a binary package or a source distrib, installation requires good experience with your operating system, but the advantage of using the source distribution is that you get to use the latest Sympa version.

==== what's the first step for installation ? ====

Check [[http://www.sympa.org/distribution/current/INSTALL]] which is included in the distribution.

==== Error: possibly undefined macro: AM_PO_SUBDIRS ====

This error message happens during the **autoconf** run if you don't have the required **gettext-devel** package (sometimes named gettext-dvl) installed on your system.

You should install the required package to complete the Sympa installation process :
  * on a RedHat system: <code>yum install gettext-devel</code>
  * on a Debian system: <code>apt-get install gettext</code>

==== Error: cannot find install-sh or install.sh ====

This error message shows while running **configure**. 

To fix the problem, you should re-run the **automake** command with the **--add-missing** option
<code>automake --add-missing</code>
