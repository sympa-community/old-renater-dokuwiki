===== handling /etc/mail/sympa.aliases with Exim4 (and Sympa >=5) =====

With a recent version of Sympa (>=5 ?), ''wws'' manages aliases automatically in ''/etc/mail/sympa_aliases'' (or ''/etc/mail/sympa.aliases'' in Debian).
However, for instance in Debian, when using it with //exim4//, you’ll need to let Exim know it should use ''/etc/mail/sympa_aliases''.

It seems to me that the following snippet should do the trick. Just copy the whole block of the "''system_aliases''" driver just bellow it, naming the new one "''sympa_aliases''", for instance, and replace the "''lsearch{/etc/aliases}''" by "''lsearch{/etc/mail/sympa.aliases}''" in the new driver. You may also need to add a ''user = sympa'' definition too in that block.

As I understand it, if the first "''system_aliases''" redirect driver fails, it will do the same with the next one ("''sympa_aliases''").

In Debian, depending on the choices of configuration for exim4, you may need to add a new file (//split config//), or change ''/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template'' (//single file//), and then update the setup with the ''update-exim4.conf'' command (''man 8 update-exim4.conf'' for more details). More details may be found in [[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=169102]].

You may also need to add ''sympa'' to the list of users in ''MAIN_TRUSTED_USERS'' variable, maybe (to be confirmed).

Hope this helps (and works)

===== Exim & Sympa =====

Context : Exim, Vmail (virtual domains with Mysql), and Sympa.
It’s not necessary to add some config directives about Sympa in exim.conf …
  * for local addresses like sympa-request@domain.tld :
    * add this in your /etc/aliases 
  mylist : "| /path/to/sympa/queue mylist@domain.tld"

  * for each virtual domain (ie : @domain2.tld) managed by the same server:
    * add this in your /etc/aliases 
  mylist_domain2_tld : "| /path/to/sympa/queue mylist@domain.tld mylist@domain2.tld"
    * AND in your virtual domains tool manager (ie : @domain2.tld), you just have to create a forwarder like this :
  mylist -> mylist_domain2_tld

It’s very simple and it work…. I suppose that your Exim is already well configured to serve messages to your virtual domains … an easy-to-use tool for managing vdomains: [[http://www.ex-parrot.com/~chris/vmail-sql/]]

===== Here is a snippet for Exim-3/Debian =====


  * Add sympa to the trusted users in main section 

  trusted_users = mail : sympa

  * Add these transports to transports section 
 
  sympa_pipe:
    driver = pipe
    command = "/usr/lib/sympa/bin/queue $local_part"
    return_path_add
    delivery_date_add
    envelope_to_add
    user = nobody
    group = nogroup
 
  sympa_special_pipe:
    driver = pipe
    command = "/usr/lib/sympa/bin/queue $local_part$local_part_suffix"
    return_path_add
    delivery_date_add
    envelope_to_add
    user = nobody
    group = nogroup
 
  sympa_bounce_pipe:
    driver = pipe
    command = "/usr/lib/sympa/bin/bouncequeue $local_part"
    return_path_add
    delivery_date_add
    envelope_to_add
    user = nobody
    group = nogroup
 

  * Add these directors to directors section 

  sympa:
    driver = smartuser

    # if you want to restrict only to some domain, put there 
    # 
    domains = liste.ac.concordia-pordenone.it

    transport = sympa_pipe
    require_files = /var/lib/sympa/list_data/$local_part
 
  sympa_special:
    driver = smartuser
                                                                                
    # if you want to restrict only to some domain, put there 
    # 
    domains = liste.ac.concordia-pordenone.it

    transport = sympa_special_pipe
    suffix = -request : -editor : -subscribe : -unsubscribe
    require_files = /var/lib/sympa/list_data/$local_part
 
  sympa_bounce: 
    driver = smartuser
                                                                                
    # if you want to restrict only to some domain, put there 
    # 
    domains = liste.ac.concordia-pordenone.it

    transport = sympa_bounce_pipe
    suffix = -owner
    require_files = /var/lib/sympa/list_data/$local_part

  * you have to add/modify the system_aliases director as:

  system_aliases:
    driver = aliasfile
    file_transport = address_file
    pipe_transport = address_pipe
    file = /etc/aliases
    search_type = lsearch
    user = sympa

Typically it suffices to add user = sympa to the end. ;)

===== Sympa aliases in Exim configure =====

If you prefer to have the aliases defined in the Exim configuration then these Routers and Transports can be used instead of updating the ''sympa.aliases'' file.

<code>
# Aliases
# Using aliases makes configuration easier to manage
# These aliases are based on FreeBSD ports and can be changed for other systems
SYMPA_EXPL   = /usr/local/sympa/list_data
SYMPA_ROBOT  = /usr/local/etc/sympa
SYMPA_QUEUE  = /usr/local/bin/queue
SYMPA_BOUNCE = /usr/local/bin/bouncequeue

# Allow exim to submit to sympa
trusted_users = sympa 

# Routers
# This accepts sympa@example.com as the command submission address
sympa_list_command:
  driver = accept
  condition        = ${if eqi{$local_part}{sympa}{1}{0}}
  require_files = +SYMPA_HOME/${lc::$domain}/robot.conf
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_bounce

list:
  driver = accept
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/${local_part}/config
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_queue

listrequest:
  driver = accept
  local_part_suffix = -request
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/${local_part}/config
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_queue

listeditor:
  driver = accept
  local_part_suffix = -editor
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/${local_part}/config
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_queue

listsubscribe:
  driver = accept
  local_part_suffix = -subscribe
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/${local_part}/config
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_queue

listunsubscribe:
  driver = accept
  local_part_suffix = -unsubscribe
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/${local_part}/config
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_queue

listowner:
  driver = accept
  local_part_suffix = -owner
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/${local_part}/config
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_bounce

listbounce:
  driver = accept
  local_part_prefix = bounce+
  require_files = +SYMPA_EXPL/${lc::$domain}/robot.conf
  retry_use_local_part
  transport = sympa_bounce


#Transports
sympa_command:
  driver = pipe
  command = "SYMPA_QUEUE sympa\@$domain"
  return_fail_output
  user = sympa

sympa_queue:
  driver = pipe
  command = "SYMPA_QUEUE ${local_part}${local_part_suffix}\@$domain"
  return_fail_output
  user = sympa

sympa_bounce:
  driver = pipe
  command = "SYMPA_BOUNCE ${local_part_prefix}${local_part}\@$domain"
  return_fail_output
  user = sympa
</code>

To switch off generating aliases set 'sendmail_aliases none' in sympa.conf

Note:
''bounce+'' prefix and ''-owner'' suffix are Sympa defaults, change them if you need to.
