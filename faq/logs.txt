===== I don't have logs for Sympa =====

On Linux systems, logs can be sent to syslogd either via UDP or via a Unix socket. On most Unix system syslogd by default syslogd only accept Unix socket. Sympa can be configured to use UDPO or Unix socket. This is controled by the log_socket_type parameter in sympa.conf. Unfortunitly, on some old Sympa versions the default for log_socket_type is inet. In this case you must either edit sympa.conf and set log_socket_type to unix.

## Communication mode with syslogd is either 'unix' (via Unix sockets) or
## 'inet' (use of UDP)
log_socket_type unix

You may prefer to start syslogd with the "-r" option :

%man syslogd
.....
-r  This option will enable the facility to receive message from
the network using an internet domain socket with the syslog service 
(see services(5)).  The default is to not receive any messages from 
the network.

This option is introduced in version 1.3 of the sysklogd package. 
Please note that the default behavior is the opposite of how older  
versions behave, so you might have to turn this on.

If Sympa log file is still empty, check some rules about syslog

    * Syslog do not create log files, you must do it yourself.
    * Log files must be created before you start syslog (restart your syslog after ratating logs !)
    * syslog.conf : no <space> char both side of log filename. <tab> and <space> are different.
    * Don't forget to send SIGHUP to syslogd after any change in syslog.conf
    * run syslogd with debug option (-d under linux) and check errors and warnings when starting

In addition you may have to change line 277 in /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.0/i386-linux/Sys/Syslog.pm to
my $syslog = &_PATH_LOG() || croak "_PATH_LOG not found in syslog.ph".

**On Solaris (7 & 8) and True64**, the '.*' level is not recognized in syslog.conf
You need to enumerate levels. Example :

  local1.info,local1.notice,local1.debug /var/log/sympa/sympa 

**On Solaris 10**, [[http://www.qmailrocks.org/qmrbb/showthread.php?t=3167|it is not possible to write syslog in a socket]]. To have logs under that system, you need to set the log_socket_type sympa.conf parameter value to "stream".

===== How to run process with debug information logged ? =====

Each demon support the option "-d". When lunched with debug option the demon run in forground  and output many debug information (thoses information are also logued. Run "sympa.pl -d" as an example. There is a exception : wwsympa.fcgi which is lunched by apache and must be a demon. Use log_level parameter in wwsympa.conf if you need that process to output a lot of logs. log_level parameter can be set in sympa.conf, wwsympa.conf or robot.conf to increase logs. When using option -d log_level is 2. log_level 3 is a very high debug level.
