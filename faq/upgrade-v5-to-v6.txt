====== Upgrading from V5 to V6 versions ======

Fast howto upgrade from version 5 to version 6. 

You may start installing a v6 from scratch in a separate location in order to test that all pre-requisite are satisfied (mainly CPAN modules). That can done from tar.gz using the followind script :

<code>
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then
   echo "missing destination directory"
   exit 1
fi

name=`basename $1`

aclocal ; autoconf; automake --add-missing;

./configure --prefix=$1 \
            --with-confdir=$1/etc \
        --with-mandir=$1/man \
            --with-initdir=/etc/init.d \
        --with-lockdir=$1/lock \
        --with-sendmail_aliases=/etc/mail/aliases-$name \
        --with-iconsdir=/var/www/icons 
</code>

Then run make, make install . All component are installed in a separate dir including sympa.conf . Edit it and configure Sympa with a database different from the database you are using with current sympa running version.

Run sympa.pl --test_database_message_buffer  in order to verify that big files can be stored in your database. [[http://www.sympa.org/manual_6.1/database#required_tunning_of_database| see section about database tunning]].

Ones this is OK, upgade is easy : 

  * prepare the sympa V6 for the standard location :
    *  aclocal ; autoconf; automake --add-missing; ./configure ; make ; 
  * sympa stop; http stop
  * save your database content
  * make install;
  * upgrade database stucture :
    * sympa.pl --upgrade ; 
    * sympa.pl  --md5_encode_password ;
  * upgrade sympa starting script because of a new deamon to start bulk.pl
  * sympa start; http start

Done
