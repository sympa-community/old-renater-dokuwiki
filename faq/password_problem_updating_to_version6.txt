====== login impossible after upgrade to version 6 ======

Starting at version 6.0 passwords are not any more stored using reversible encryption. A MD5 fingerprint is used. So when updating from previous version, you must decrypt existing password are rewrite them in the database as MD5 fingerprint. 

This operation is done using  :
<code>sympa.pl --md5_encode_password</code>

It is **not reversible** that's why you should save the database before and that's also the reason why Sympa author's did not include this operation in the automatic upgrade process.
