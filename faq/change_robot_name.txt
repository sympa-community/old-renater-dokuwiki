====== How can I change my robot name? ======

Once in a while, you can feel the need to change your robot name.
First, stop Sympa.

===== Robot renaming in a nutshell =====

In any case, you first need to [[../manual/virtual-hosts#how_to_create_a_virtual_host|create a virtual host]] corresponding to your new robot name.

Then, you will have to migrate existing list on this new robot.

You will then have to modify or move the following:

  * lists' archives,
  * lists' spools,
  * the database.

These operations can be done following two different steps.

===== Solution 1: through the web GUI =====

//Once your new robot is created//, you can rename (one by one) any list you own.
This can be done by using the renaming page in the web interface, following this path in the menu:

''Admin -> Rename list''

In this very simple interface, retype the current list's name in the "New list name:" field then select the new robot name in the drop-down menu.

Confirm changes by clicking the "Rename the list" button.

That's it. All the list's archives, spools and database entries are moved/renamed as necessary in the process.

Go on to the next list, and so on until you renamed all your lists.
Keep on trucking. ;-)

===== Solution 2: using console =====

You can choose to make these modifications using //sympa.pl// which can be a good option if you have a very large number of lists to move.

Note that <nowiki>sympa.pl --rename_list</nowiki> was introduced in Sympa 6.1.
